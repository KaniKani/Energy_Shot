<h1>Energy Shot - Rulebook</h1>
<p><em>Fast, strategic, chaotic fun with Energy cards!</em></p>

<h2>1. Game Setup</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use a custom deck of Energy cards, including:
    <ul>
      <li>9 cards each of the 9 basic Energy types (Grass, Fire, Water, Lightning, Psychic, Fighting, Metal, Fairy, Darkness)</li>
      <li>At least 2 Dragon Energy cards (special win condition)</li>
      <li>Rocket's Darkness Energy card(s) (special effect + Dark Energy)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Shuffle the deck well.</li>
  <li>Each player draws 3 cards for their starting hand.</li>
  <li>Each player has their own Energy Zone (area in front of them to place one Energy card per turn).</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Card Zones</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hand:</strong> Your private cards.</li>
  <li><strong>Energy Zone:</strong> Where you can place one Energy card per turn from your hand. Up to 5 different Energy types allowed in the Energy Zone.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Turn Structure</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Draw 1 card from the deck.</li>
  <li>Choose one action to perform:
    <ul>
      <li>Play an Energy card to your Energy Zone (only one card per turn).</li>
      <li>Play a Combo from your hand (discard the necessary Energy cards and perform its effect).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you have more than 5 cards in hand at the end of your turn, discard down to 5.</li>
</ol>

<h2>4. Energy Zone Card Effects</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Dark: </strong>You and the person counterclockwise take a sip!</li>
    <li><strong>Fairy: </strong>Reverse any rule until your next turn!</li>
    <li><strong>Fire: </strong>Sip and burn someone else to take 2 sips!</li>
    <li><strong>Fighting: </strong>Throw dice with anyone. Whichever throws lower loses and sips! (in case of no dice, Rock Paper Scizzors also works here!)</li>
    <li><strong>Electric: </strong>Zap the entire table. Everyone sips!</li>
    <li><strong>Grass: </strong>You've been healed. Skip your next drink!</li>
    <li><strong>Psychic: </strong>Choose anyone to throw dice with. Same number, everyone else drinks. Different number, both of you drink! (in case of no dice, the person clockwise to you shares a sip with you)</li>
    <li><strong>Metal: </strong>You're built like Cbum, give 3 drinks to anyone! (can be multiple people)</li>
    <li><strong>Water: </strong>Hydrate. Drink some water you thirsty bitch!</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Combos</h2>
<p>To play a combo, discard the required Energy cards from your hand and apply the effect.</p>
